It is Product inventory managment system which has some category based product choosing and if product is available then the bill is generated. Otherwise bill will not be generated. I have used dictionary to implement it.
I have uploaded 2 files along with main file. 
1.record.json
    It contains products details.<br>
2.sales.json
    It contains sales data

This includes follwoing options:
1.Adding new record
2.Updating price
3.Updating quantity
4.Generate bills
5.Purchase the product
